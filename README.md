# Logging NAT Translations on PF firewalls

PFNATTRACK is a tool that can be used to keep track and logging of NAT translations in PF (Packet Filter) firewalls. The logging capability for Network Address Translations is an important step for Computer Security Incident Handling. Usually, the security incidents notifications reported to your institution came only with public IP address, date/time and source port, making it difficult to find the internal machine related to the issue.

Using PFNATTRACK you will get logs such as:
```
